<h2><a name="backupSettings"></a>Backup Settings</h2>

<P>
	Once
        you have the Access Point working properly, you should back up the
        information to have it available if something goes wrong. When you
        backup the settings, they are saved as a file on your computer. This
        section allows you to back up the Access Point&rsquo;s current
        settings. </P>

<P>Click
        Backup to create a backup file of the current settings:</P>
