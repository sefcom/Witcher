<h2><a name="general"></a>General</h2>

<P>
		This page lets you configure the basic settings of your Access
            Point. </P>
                   
<P><B>Access Point Name</B></P>
            <P>This unique value indicates the Access Point NETBIOS name. The
            default Access Point Name is on the bottom label of the WN604. By
            default, the name is netgearxxxxxx, where xxxxxx represents the last
            six hexadecimal digits of the WN604 MAC address.</P>
            <P>NETGEAR recommends changing the name as soon as possible after
            setting up the Access Point. The name must contain only alphabets,
            numbers, hyphens and underscores, and must be 15 characters or less.</P>
            <P><B>Country/Region</B></P>
            <P>This field displays the region of operation for which the Access
            Point is intended.</P>
            <P>For products sold in the United States, the default country is
            preset and can not be changed. For products sold outside of the
            United States, you must select a country or region. It may not be
            legal to operate the access point in a country/region other than the
            country/region shown here. If your country or region is not listed,
            you must check with your local government agency or check the NETGEAR
            Website for more information on which channels to use.</P>

<!-- <h3><a name="spanningTreeProtocol"></a>Spanning Tree Protocol</h3> 
<P>A Spanning tree protocol provides network traffic optimization in
            locations where multiple Access Points are present. Based on the
            presence of one or more Access Points, enable or disable the Spanning
            Tree Protocol option in this section.</P>

<h3><a name="802_1QVLAN"></a>802.1Q VLAN</h3>
<P>The 802.1Q VLAN protocol on the Access Point logically separates
            traffic on the same physical network.</P>

<P><B>Untagged VLAN</B></P>
<P>When checked, this option allows one VLAN to be configured as an
            &quot;untagged VLAN&quot;. When the Access Point sends frames
            associated with the untagged VLAN out the LAN (Ethernet) interface,
            those frames will be untagged. When the Access Point receives
            untagged traffic from the LAN (Ethernet) interface, those frames are
            assigned to the untagged VLAN.</P>
            <P>If unchecked, the Access Point tags all outgoing LAN (Ethernet)
            frames, and only accepts incoming frames that are tagged with known
            VLAN IDs.</P>
            <P><B>Note: </B>The Untagged VLAN checkbox should only be unchecked
            if the hubs or switches on your LAN support the VLAN (802.1Q)
            standard. Likewise, the Untagged VLAN value should only be changed if
            the hubs/switches on your LAN support the VLAN (802.1Q) standard.
            Changing either of these values will result in a loss of IP
            connectivity if the hubs/switches on your network have not yet been
            configured with the corresponding VLANs.</P>
            <P><B>Management VLAN</B></P>
            <P>Management VLANs are used for managing traffic (Telnet, SNMP, and
            HTTP) to and from the Access Point.</P>
            <P>Frames belonging to the Management VLAN are not given any 802.1Q
            header when sent over the trunk. If a port is in a single VLAN, it
            can be untagged. But if the port needs to be a member of multiple
            VLANs, it must be tagged.</P>
